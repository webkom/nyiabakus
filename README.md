## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies using yarn

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The site is then presented on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To modify the dynamically loaded data through sanity go to: [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio)

## Types from Sanity Schemas

If you update or create any sanity schemas make sure to update the types:

```bash
yarn sanity:typegen
```

Dont create types based on schemas yourself, instead use the ones generated by this to avoid making wrong types.
